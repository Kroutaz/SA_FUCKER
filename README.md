 # Warning
- Mobile is NOT supported.
- The only way to run Sa Fucker on mobile is to connect a keyboard to your phone, either IRL or Via a Script that you could find on google (Virtual keyboards)
 # Sa Fucker
- This script has been made by Kroutaz (Discord user: "kroutaz") And Wizz7 (Discord user: "skilzed.")
- This script countain mostly pvp scripts (It is not one of those trashy grinding gui) some of the examples are no cooldown, 15 Seconds time stop...
- It is open source! Go in script.lua, Copy the whole code and paste it into your executor and you will be able to use it and modify it however you want!
 # Loadstring
	loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kroutaz/SA_FUCKER/refs/heads/main/script.lua"))()
 - You can put the loadstring up there {^} to load Sa Fucker directly into your executor without having to copy and paste the entire code who is around 1100 lines. Some executors doesnt support loadstrings tho.
